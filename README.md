# Hedera DID Method v2.0: Specification & Proof of Concept

Welcome to the repository for the **Hedera DID Method v2.0**. This space serves as the central hub for the development and validation of the next iteration of decentralized identifiers on Hedera.

Our primary goal with v2.0 is to fully align the `did:hedera` method with W3C DID Core standards, particularly by implementing a robust controller-based authorization model secured by W3C Data Integrity proofs.

**Inside this repository, you will find:**

* The **evolving specification document** for Hedera DID Method v2.0, detailing its architecture, operations, and security considerations.
* Runnable **Proof of Concept (PoC) implementations** designed to validate key v2.0 features. These PoCs demonstrate practical application of the core mechanisms, including:
    * Controller and multi-controller functionality.
    * Key rotation procedures.
    * Support for verification methods like `Multikey` and `JsonWebKey2020`.
* The **PoC Plan** that outlines the objectives, scope, and approach for these validation efforts.
* (Eventually) Test vectors and potentially schema definitions for v2.0.

We encourage you to explore the specification, examine the PoC plan, and run the PoC implementations (as they become available) to understand and contribute to the development of `did:hedera` v2.0.
